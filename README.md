# Hello stranger!
I am Sergio, a "Computer Science" student at Spain. As you may already guess this is my GitHub profile.


## My machine
Let's start from the beginning. My personal machine runs only Linux (did I said it runs Arch? _btw i use arch_. In fact I run ArcoLinux, I'm not such a masochist to run ArchLinux).

You'll see that **Lua** is one of the languages that I've worked the most on. That is because I use NeoVim to code when the university does not force me to use other IDE. Nevertheless I don't believe that I have a good knowledge of Lua but I hope I can improve my skills.


## What do I know?
I have worked with C++ to understand the basics of programming. But currently Java is the language that I'm learning the most. Even though I'm not a mathematician I use a lot LaTeX. But I'm not stopping there. I a now learning quite a lot of Python since I join the Driverless department at UVigo Motorsport.

Currently:
- Developing NeoVim config(always)
- Learning ROS2
- Linux
