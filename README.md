# Hello stranger!
I am Sergio, a "Computer Science" student at Spain. As you may already guess this is my GitHub profile.


## My machine
Let's start from the beginning. My personal machine runs only Linux (did I said it runs Arch? _btw i use arch_. In fact I run ArcoLinux, I'm not such a masochist to run ArchLinux).

You'll see that **Lua** is the language that I've worked the most on. That is because I run AwesomeWM as my window manager and I use NeoVim to code when the university does not force me to use other IDE. Nevertheless I don't believe that I have a good knowledge of Lua but I hope I can develop my skills.


## What do I know?
I have worked with C++ to understand the basics of programming. But currently Java is the language that I'm learning the most.

Even though I'm not a mathematician I love LaTeX (I recall saying that I'm not a masochist, maybe I'm just a little). Why LaTeX? C'mon it's just gorgeous to see a PDF made in LaTeX.

I know a bit of:
- Python
- Julia
- Bash

Currently:
- Developing NeoVim config
- Learning Julia
