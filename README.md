# Hello stranger!
I am Sergio, a "Computer Science" student at Spain. As you may already guess this is my GitHub profile.

## What do I know?
You'll see that **Lua** is one of the languages that I've worked the most on. That is because I use NeoVim to code whenever I'm able to. Nevertheless I don't believe that I have a good knowledge of Lua but I hope I can improve my skills.

I have worked with C++ to understand the basics of programming. But currently Java is the language that I'm learning the most. Even though I'm not a mathematician I know the basics LaTeX. But I'm not stopping there. I'm now learning quite a lot of Python since I joined the Driverless department at UVigo Motorsport. 

My mind can't be bored, that is why I am constantly finding new skills.
